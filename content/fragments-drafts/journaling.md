I find the exercise incredibly useful because it gives me an opportunity to
throw words down on paper with wild abandon. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and
whenever I know that what I write might be visible publicly, getting anything
down is an excruciatingly slow process as I painfully deliberate over every
single word. That extra writing helps improve my technique, but has the
secondary benefit of "warming me up" so that after finishing a day's journal I
can transition over to some sort of public writing and do it more effectively.

The most important 

There are so many life experiences that I've effectively forgotten because
unless I have some sort of memory aid to bring them to light, my mind will
never naturally wander over to them.

Even reading over entries from the last month reminds me of experiences that
would have mostly faded by now, but seeing my written word brings them back in
an instant.
