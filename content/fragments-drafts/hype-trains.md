One thing that the tech industry does well is hype. An idea gets pitched once,
and momentum around it grows as more people dip their toes in and begin selling
it themselves. This often takes the form of a series of blog posts that hit
Hacker News.

Here are a few technologies and ideas that I remember seeing a lot of hype
around during their early release:

* Node.JS.
* MongoDB.
* EventMachine.
* Erlang.
* Callback-based programming paradigms.
* Companies should be mostly remote with no managers.
* Frameworks are bad. Libraries are good.
* Agile methodology.
* Static site generators.

In retrospect, I now know that many of these things aren't net positives. But
at the time, the articles, talks, and people championing them seemed incredibly
compelling.

While as an industry we're great at building and driving hype trains, we're not
so good at dismantling them when it's appropriate to do so.

I'd posit that companies that have had a major hand in selling a technology
might have some moral responsibility in helping to tip the scale back in the
other direction if and when they discover that it's not quite as idyllic as
they'd originally portrayed. The justification is simple: starting to use a new
technology is a lengthy commitment, and replacing it is a massive undertaking.
If it's discovered that certain pieces of technology are bad apples, a
well-written piece on the subject can save tens of thousands of misguided
engineering hours overall.

Not all bad things are unambiguously bad of course, but some are, and should be
avoided in practically every imaginable situation. I won't say which, but there
are a few of those in the list above.
