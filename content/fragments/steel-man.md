While listening to Sam Harris' _Waking Up_ this morning, the debate technique
of a ["steel man"][steel-man] came up, which was a new one to me.

While the term of a "straw man" has now entered common vernacular these days,
especially in the computing industry, its opposite idea is much less common.
While the straw man refers to building a position that mischaracterizes your
opponent's view or is otherwise easy to defeat, a steel man builds an argument
that's _better_ constructed than an opponent may have been able to do. Tearing
it down is proportionally more difficult, and doing so further solidifies your
own position.
