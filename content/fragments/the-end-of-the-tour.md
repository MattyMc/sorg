★ ★ ★ ★ (out of five)

I didn't have a clue that a movie about David Foster Wallace was even in the
works, let alone being already released, so it was a bit of a surprise today
when a friend suggested going to see one. [The End of the Line][wikipedia]
portrays the end of Wallace's tour for _Infinite Jest_ in 1996, where he was
accompanied by a reporter for the _Rolling Stone_ on a trip to a reading in
Minneapolis.

Although [_Infinite Jest_ was a little too abstract for my taste][my-review], I
do appreciate that Wallace has a way with words that makes him an important
figure in the literary history of our generation. Digging into his personality
a little more through the movie was much more revealing than reading Wikipedia
or other biographical documents on him could ever be (even if it depends
heavily on the reporter's recollection of events). I had roughly the same
reaction to the movie that I did after reading Walter Isaacson's _Steve Jobs_.
I'd already implicitly built an internal representation of Wallace based on
what I'd read about him and the work that he'd done, and what I saw here
challenged it significantly.

Seeing Jason Segel in the role of Wallace was a surprise (I hadn't read any
material beforehand), and him pulling off the role brilliantly was an even
bigger one. The acting all around was strong and believable.

A little like _Infinite Jest_ itself, this movie is one of depth and subtlety.
Viewers are given a glimpse into very human and very relatable characters who
bond over insightful conversations on a wide range of topics. At its
conclusion, you're left with wisdom and a view of Wallace which is both
subjective and incomplete, but still satisfying. Recommended.
